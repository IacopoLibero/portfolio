## Overview

Development of a fully responsive e-commerce platform with a modern user interface, product catalog and fake shopping cart.

## Key Features

- **Product Catalog**: Created a dynamic product listing with filtering and sorting capabilities for easy product discovery.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured seamless experience across devices from mobile to desktop.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core front-end technologies for structure, styling, and interactivity.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries and flexible layouts for all device sizes.
- **Payment Integration**: Simulated payment processing for demonstration purposes.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was creating an intuitive shopping experience while managing product data efficiently. I learned a lot about state management in frontend applications and how to design user-friendly shopping flows that reduce cart abandonment.

## Outcome

The final platform offers a smooth, intuitive shopping experience with fast loading times and responsive design. This project demonstrates my ability to build commercial web applications with attention to both user experience and technical functionality.
