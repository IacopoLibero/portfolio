## Overview

The "Mercatino Meucci" project is a web-based platform I developed for my school, allowing students to buy and sell used textbooks, school supplies, and other items. This marketplace aims to promote sustainability and resource sharing within the school community, while providing students with an affordable alternative to purchasing new items. The platform features a simple, intuitive interface built with responsive design principles to ensure accessibility across all devices.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for students to create and manage their accounts.
- **Product Listings**: Students can easily create, edit, and delete listings for items they want to sell.
- **Search Functionality**: Advanced search and filtering options to help students find specific items quickly.
- **Messaging System**: Integrated communication system allowing buyers and sellers to discuss items and arrange exchanges.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface ensuring students can access the marketplace from any device.
- **Category Management**: Items organized by categories for better browsing experience.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting for dynamic content and database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Database management for storing user data, product listings, and messages.
- **JavaScript**: Enhanced client-side interactivity and form validations.
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for responsive and modern UI components.
- **CSS**: Custom styling to create a unique and engaging user interface.
- **HTML**: Structuring the web application's content.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was implementing a secure authentication system to protect student data and ensure that only verified school members could participate in the marketplace. I also had to carefully design the database schema to efficiently handle relationships between users, listings, and messages. This project provided valuable experience in full-stack development, particularly in connecting front-end interfaces with back-end functionality and database operations.

## Outcome

The Mercatino Meucci marketplace has successfully created a sustainable ecosystem for exchanging school materials within our institution. It has significantly reduced waste by giving new life to used textbooks and supplies, while helping students save money. The platform has been well-received by both students and teachers, and continues to be an important resource for our school community.
