## Overview

"Ec(h)o d'Arte" is a landing website I developed as part of a group project at the University of Bologna. The website serves as a digital presence for a cultural association that promotes access to performing arts in the suburbs of Bologna. The site showcases the association's mission, upcoming events, past festivals, and provides information about their flagship event "Sulla stessa Barca." With a clean, artistic design, the website effectively communicates the organization's commitment to using art as a tool for urban regeneration, inclusion, and social cohesion.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across all devices.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Dynamic menu system that allows visitors to easily navigate between different sections of the website.
- **Event Showcase**: Dedicated sections for highlighting past festivals and promoting upcoming events, particularly the "Sulla stessa Barca" festival.
- **Contest Registration**: Integration with Google Forms to allow users to register for the freestyle rap contest.
- **Countdown Timer**: Interactive countdown displaying time until registration opens for events.
- **Contact Form**: User-friendly form for visitors to reach out to the association.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structured semantic markup for content organization and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with variables for consistent theming and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity for dynamic content loading and user interface enhancements.
- **Google Fonts**: Integration of web fonts for typography enhancement.
- **Form Integration**: Connection to external form services for contest registration.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was creating an aesthetically pleasing website that reflected the artistic nature of the association while maintaining usability and performance. I focused on finding the right balance between visual appeal and functionality. Working on this project as part of a team also provided valuable experience in collaborative web development, including version control, task division, and integrating different components created by team members into a cohesive whole.

## Outcome

The Ec(h)o d'Arte website successfully serves as a digital platform for the cultural association, effectively communicating their mission, events, and initiatives to their target audience. The website has helped increase awareness of the association's activities and facilitated community engagement through features like event information and contest registration. The clean design and intuitive navigation enhance the user experience, making it easy for visitors to find relevant information.
